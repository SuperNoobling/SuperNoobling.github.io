To make a website, we need to give some instructions to the computer. We can't just type the text that will be on the site (like you would in a word processor like Word or OpenOffice), we also need to say where to put the text, insert images, create links between pages, etc.

## The role of HTML & CSS
To explain to the computer what you're going to do, you need to use a language it understands. And this is where things get a bit tricky, because you need to know two languages!

> Why have two languages? Wouldn't just one be enough?

You're probably thinking that learning two languages will be twice as hard and twice as long to learn...but it's not true! Believe me, the reason there are two languages is to make things easier. We're going to deal with two languages that complete each other, because they do different things:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML made its appearance in 1991 at the beginning of the web. Its role is to manage and organise the content. So you use HTML to write what needs to be displayed on the page: text, links, images... It's kind of like saying "This is my title, this is my menu, this is the main text, here's an image to display, etc."

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS takes care of the appearance of the web page (arrangement, positioning, decoration, colours, font sizes...). This language was added in 1996 to go with HTML.
