Don't be afraid to ask questions even if they seem "dumb". It's very important to talk a bit about it before diving into making websites!

I'm sure you use websites every day. To do so, you open a program called a web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari. You can visit any website you like with your browser.

I'm sure you're used to using a web browser! These days everyone knows how to surf the web... but who knows how the web really works? How do you make websites like this one?

> I've heard about HTML and CSS, do they have anything to do with how web sites work?

Yes! These are computer languages that allow people to make websites. All websites are based on these languages, they're essential and universal. They constitute the very basis of the web. The HTML language was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991...

Tim Berners-Lee still carefully monitors the evolution of the web. He created the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that defines the new versions of web languages. He also created the World Wide Web Foundation that analyses and monitors the evolution of the web.

Many people mix up the internet and the web. The web is a part of the internet.
The internet is a huge thing that includes: the web, emails, instant messaging, etc.
Tim Berners-Lee isn't the inventor of the internet, but the inventor of the web.

The HTML and CSS languages form the basis of all websites. When you visit a website with your browser, there is all kinds of stuff going on behind the scenes so the website displays. The computer reads what we've explained in HTML and CSS to know what to display.

HTML and CSS are two "languages" that you have to speak to make websites. The web browser will translate from these computer languages to whatever you see displayed on the screen.

You must be wondering why you have to know two languages to make websites? You'll find out in the next section!
