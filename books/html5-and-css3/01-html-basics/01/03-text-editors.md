> What software do I need to make a website? Will I need to break my piggybank to buy complicated software that'll take months to understand?

There's lots of software for making websites. But honestly, you won't need to pay a cent. Why go for an expensive, complicated program when you already have everything you need?

Ready to find out what the fantastical program you're going to need is? Da da da... Notepad!

Amazing but true: you can actually make a website with just Notepad (or TextEdit if you're on a Mac), the text editor that came free with your computer. It's actually how I first started a few years ago.

But there are many programs out there that are far more powerful, and no one really uses Notepad. These web development programs can be categorised into two types:

## WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
These programs are easy to use, and allow people to make websites without learning any specific language. The most well-known one is Adobe Dreamweaver, and more recently Adobe Muse. You can even make websites in Word and OpenOffice! The main problem with these programs is the bad quality HTML and CSS that is generated. A good web developer will need to learn HTML and CSS anyway, that's why I recommend avoiding these tools.

## Text editors
These are specialised programes for writing code. Usually you can use them for multiple languages, not just HTML and CSS. They're web developer's best friends!

## Installation
You've probably realised I'm going to suggest you use a text editor for this course. Here's a bit of advice, depending on whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Windows
There are loads of text editors, and I can't list them all here. But you should try out [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/fr/), one of the most popular text editors for Windowsâ€”it's a simple program, free to download. I also suggest you set the language to HTML (Language > H > HTML). This lets the software know you're going to type HTML, and colours the code. Coloured code helps you read it more easily.

There are other editors available too, if Notepad++ doesn't much tickle your fancy:

- jEdit
- PSpad
- Brackets
- and you can find many more by searching for "text editor" on the internet

### Mac
There are some very nice paid text editors for Mac, but there are also some good free ones you can try:

- TextMate 2
- TextWrangler
- Brackets

### Linux
Text editors are abundant in Linux. Some are installed by default, others can be downloaded via the download center or command line tools like apt-get. Here are some you can try:

- Geany
- gEdit
- Kate
