title: And the competition?
book: Build dynamic websites with PHP & MySQL

HTML and CSS don't have competitors because they're standards. Everyone needs to use them on all web sites. But as for dynamic web sites, PHP and MySQL are far from being alone. I can't list all their competitors, that would be too long (and boring!). But for your general knowledge, you do need to know at least a few other big names.

First of all, even if we often combine PHP and MySQL to build powerful dynamic sites, it's important not to mix them up. The Ô¨Årst has different competitors to the latter.

##PHP competitors
Here are some well-known PHP competitors:

### ASP.NET
This language, designed by Microsoft, uses the .NET framework (a collection of libraries that provide services for developers), which is well known by C# developers. This language might be interesting if you're used to developing in C# .NET and you don't want to get disorientated.

### Ruby on Rails
This very active framework is used with the Ruby language and allows you to build dynamic sites quickly, and following certain conventions.

### Django
Very similar to Ruby on Rails, but it uses the Python language.

### Java and JSP (Java Server Pages)
More commonly called "JEE", this language is often used in the institutional world. It requires a lot of rigour. Setting up a JEE project traditionally takes longer and is slower, but the system is appreciated by institutions. The French tax office uses it for example.

I can't list all the rivals here, but that should give you an idea. For the record, it's also possible to use the C or C++ language, but it's far more complex and not necessarily well suited (in other words, I don't recommend it at all).

### Which should I choose? Which one is the best?
Given the goal of this book, you'd be forgiven for assuming I'll reply "PHP!". But no actually, it all depends on your programming knowledge. If you've already used Java, you'll be up and running quickly with JSP. If you know Python, Django is a good option.

As for PHP, it stands out from it's rivals thanks to a huge internet community that can quickly help you if you have problems. It's an easy language to use, ideal for beginners as well as professionals: Wikipedia and Facebook are examples of famous high-traffic sites that work with PHP.

In short, there is no best choice. I recommend the language you know you'll have someone to help you with. PHP is often a good choice in this regard.

## MySQL competitors
As for databases, the choice is also huge. But while PHP and its competitors are largely free and open-source, this is not the case for most DBMS. Among MySQL competitors, you should probably know about:

### Oracle
This is the most famous DBMS, the most powerful and complete. Sadly it's not free (and quite expensive), which leaves it more for businesses that already use it. There are free versions of Oracle however, particularly for those who want to learn to use it.

### Microsoft SQL Server
Released by Microsoft, this one is often used in combination with ASP.NET, even though it can be used with any other language. It's a paid system, but there are limited free versions.

### PostgreSQL
This is a free and open-source DBMS like MySQL, that has more advanced features. It's sometimes compated to Oracle, but it has a way to go yet. It has a slightly smaller community than MySQL and Oracle.

### Well that's all rather lovely...
Again, this list is far from complete but presents at least a few big names. Just so you know, MySQL is by far the  most used free and open-source DBMS. Among the paid professional solutions, Oracle is the most advanced and renowned but it's mostly used in big companies.

Ultimately, if you're on a limited budget, you don't have much choice for a DBMS. MySQL is the most appropriate because it's free, open-source, efficient and used by many people that may be able to help you.
Different combinations are possible

## Conclusion
As you've noticed, you have a choice between many tools to build a dynamic site. Most of these are free.

Note that in theory you can combine these tools however you like. For example, you could use PHP with a different database than MySQL, such as Oracle or PostgreSQL. Likewise, MySQL can be used with any other language: Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

However the "PHP + MySQL" combination is probably the most common. It's is not by accident that this book deals with these two tools that have demonstrated success.
