There are 2 types of web sites:  
- **Static:** these are built with *HTML* and *CSS*, and their content can only be updated by the web administrator  
- **Dynamic:** these are built with other tools like *PHP* and *MySQL* as well as HTML and CSS, and they allow visitors to contribute to the site, post messages…in short, to let the site live a little!

--

*Site visitors are called clients*. They ask the server that hosts the site to send them web pages.

--

*PHP is a language executed on the server*. It lets you personalise a web page depending on the visitor, handle messages, do calculations, etc. It generates an HTML page.

--

*MySQL is a database management system*. It's in charge of storing information (list of messages, members…).
