There are basically two types of web sites - static sites and dynamic sites.

## Static web sites
These are built with only HTML and CSS. They work really well but their content can't be automatically updatedâ€”the site administrator has to modify the source code to add new stuff. Not very handy when you need to update your site multiple times on the same day! Static sites are good for making "brochure" sites, like for presenting your business, but not much more. This type of site is becoming rarer these days, because as soon as we add an interactive element (like a contact form), it's not a static site anymore but a dynamic one.

## Dynamic sites
These are more complicated and use other languages as well as HTML and CSS, such as PHP and MySQL. The content of these web sites is "dynamic" because it can change without the site administrator needing to do anything! Most web sites that you visit now, including this one, are dynamic sites. The only prerequisite for learning to make these sorts of sites is that you already know how to make static sites in HTML and CSS.

The aim of this book is to get you building dynamic web sites all by yourself, step by step. Dynamic web sites can have much more exciting features than static ones. Here are some of the things you'll be able to build a:

- **members-only area:** your visitors can sign up to your site and access members-only content
- **forum:** it's pretty common these days to see forums on web sites for getting help or just hanging out
- **page hit counter:** you can easily count the number of visitors that log in to your site during the day, or even know the number of visitors currently browsing!
- **blog:** you can automate the writing of articles, by letting your visitors write them, comment on them, etc.
- **newsletter:** you can send regular emails to all your members to show them new stuff and get them to come back to your site

Obviously these are just examples. You can go much further, it all depends on what you need. For example, almost all online games are dynamic. There are virtual pet sites, space conquest games, etc.

But let's not get carried away. Before getting there, you've got some reading to do and lot's of stuff to learn! Let's start with the basics: do you know what happens when you browse a web page?
