Ok, so we know that PHP is executed on the server and that its job is to generate web pages. But only a server can read PHPâ€”and your computer isn't a server. How on earth are we going to be able to create a dynamic site if PHP doesn't work on your machine?

No worries: we'll temporarily transform your computer into a server so you can run PHP and work on your dynamic site. You'll be ready to code by the end of this chapter!
