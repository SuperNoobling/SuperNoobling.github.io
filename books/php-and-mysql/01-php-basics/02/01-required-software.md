You need different software for building static or dynamic sites. Building a dynamic site requires some extra programs!

## Start with these
Web developers who build static sites in HTML and CSS are lucky, they generally already have the programs they need.

### A text editor
In theory a program such as Notepad (which comes free with Windows) or TextEdit (which comes free with Macs), is enough. But it's better to use a more specialized tool like Notepad++ or TextWrangler. We'll come back to choosing a text editor at the end of this chapter.

### A web browser
You need a browser to test the web page. You can use Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or any other browser you're used to using to surf the web. You should always test your site on different browsers.


## Then add these
However for those of us who work on dynamic websites, these tools are not enough. You'll need to install a few extra programs.

For your computer to be able to read PHP, it needs to behave like a server. Don't worry, you don't need to buy a special computer for this: you just need to install the same programs that are installed on servers that send websites to users. So what are these programs we're going to need?

### Apache
This is what is called a web server. It's the most important program, because it's in charge of sending the web pages to visitors. But Apache can only manage static websites, so we need other programs too.

### PHP
This is a plugin for Apache that lets it deal with dynamic web pages in PHP. By combining Apache and PHP, your computer will be able to read web pages in PHP.

### MySQL
This is the database software we mentioned in the introduction. It allows you to save data in an organised way (such as the list of members of your site). We won't need it right away, but we may as well install the lot.


## Conclusion
All these tools that will help us build dynamic websites are free and open source. Obviously there are others (sometimes paid), but the Apache + PHP + MySQL combination is the most common setup on web servers, and there are ready-made "packs" that contain all these programs. It's possible to install them one by one but that takes more time and you probably won't gain anything (unless you're a server administrator, which probably isn't your case).

In the rest of this chapter, we'll see how to install the "pack" you need depending on your operating system.
