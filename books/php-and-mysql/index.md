Blogs, social networks, personal home pages... Over the last few years, web sites have been adding more features and have become more and more complex in the process. The days of the personal home page are long gone! There was a time when we were happy making basic sites—a bit of text, a few images, and boom—personal home page done. 

These days things have changed—it has to be dynamic! We expect sites to be regularly updated: we want to see news on the home page, be able to leave comments, chat on forums, and contribute to the site.

The PHP language was designed for building "living" sites (dynamic sites). And if you want to learn to create dynamic sites, today is your lucky day—this book is for absolute beginners! 

It's important to fully read the chapters in order. Later it'll all come together and you'll be surprised at what you're able to do! To use PHP, you must already know HTML and CSS. If you don't know them yet, you'll have to go read some tutorials and then come back (don't worry, it won't take long to learn basic HTML and CSS).
