Super Noobling is a project that has been slowly bubbling in my mind for a while now. I'm a front-end developer and freelance French-English translator, and most of what I've learned about making websites was gleamed from a hodge-podge of random tutorials on the internet over the years, combined with a whole lot of experimentation. When I first started learning—quite a few years ago now—there weren't as many resources around as there are these days. Now just filtering through them all to find the good ones is a problem in itself.

This website was created as a way to thank the internet for being so awesome (thank you internet), and as a place for others to learn to be awesome too. It's a work in progress that I hope will improve with time.

The first book on this site is a translation and adaptation of the introductory PHP book from Site du Zéro (which was recently rebranded OpenClassrooms, not sure why). Site du Zéro is a popular French website created in 1999, and has some very noob-friendly programming tutorials. At the time of writing there is no English language version of the website, but many of the courses/books were released under a Creative Commons license, which means I can put my translation skills to use and provide another great resource for English speakers.

I'll be making other books available that will help anyone to learn the skills needed to make awesome websites, like HTML and CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and WordPress. 

This entire website is open-source, runs on Jekyll, and is hosted on GitHub. Anyone can contribute to the project and help improve it or make corrections. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SuperNoobling) for more information.

P.S. I think I need to find a good synonym for awesome.
